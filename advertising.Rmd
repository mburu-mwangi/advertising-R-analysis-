## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

head(advert_data)
```


```{r}
# checking the bottom
#
tail(advert_data)
```
```{r}
# checking the shape of the data
#
dim(advert_data)
```
The advert dataset has 1000 rows and 10 columns
```{r}
# Checking whether each column has an appropriate datatype

str(advert_data)
```
## 4. External Validation

## 5. Tidying the dataset
```{r}
